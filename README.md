# Git Practice
Hi! This is Taoming Liu's Git Exercise.

* [Link - Summary of GPU Optimizations](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/shared/papers/algorithm2012.pdf)

### My comments
* As GPU becomes more and more "general purpose" in this era, developers need to know more about how to utilize GPUs to optimize their programs. This article summarize a list of algorithms and techniques used in modern GPU optimizations. These methods can enhance the performance of applicable kernels by 2 to 10Ã— in current processors, while they also improves future scability. While the article can be a bit technicle in some sense, and much of the content I couldn't really understand, I still think these are important knowlegdes for software engineers (perhaps more important for machine learning engineers or scientists).
